# Maze of Madness

## High Concept:
The game is similar to pacman in that you are being chased by enemies through a maze. However, in this game you are able to shoot enemies in front of you, and you are actually able to get to the other side of the maze and escape.

## Genere:
•Arcade	
•Shooter	
•Puzzle	


## Platform:
For now, I plan for the game to only be available on desktop.

## Story:
This game follows your avatar lost in an ancient maze as old as time itself. Equipped with only his trusty hand gun, he must fight off the maze’s guardians and escape back up to the surface. You will play as this character solving multiple mazes all while fighting off enemies that are trying to stop your escape.

## Esthetics:
The graphic style of this game will be relatively simple using plain colors and not much shading for much of the sprites. Sound will also be pretty simple probably being similar to that of old retro games. Sounds in this game will be used for shooting, game over, victory, UI effects, and probably a little bit of background music.

## Gameplay:
Players will control the avatar and be able to move him in any of the cardinal directions in order to solve the maze. They will also be able to shoot a projectile in front of them to try and shoot enemies. WSAD will be used to control player movement and spacebar will be used to shoot. The game is simple enough that before the game starts an instruction screen will show up teaching the player the controls, and from there they’ll be thrown straight into the game. However, I plan that enemies will get faster and harder to avoid as the player progresses allowing for a bit of a learning curve. To perform well in this game I expect that players are going to have to learn how to balance patience with urgency. They’ll have to be able to wait to get a good angle on enemies to eliminate them, but also know when to quickly progress towards the end of the maze.
